HJCache is library for asynchronous download of images and other data over the net, and for sharing 
and caching them. Its for iPhone / iOS, it works with data other than images too, and its free.
The library is designed to make it easy to make fast scrolling table views (for example) that contain
imaged loaded from URLs. Eg a twitter app that shows the profile pic for each post in each table cell.
